# Mini  Recap Project : NASA





### Before start 

 - Clone this repository
 - Go to [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov) and create your api key.






### What we are going to develop ?


In start file , there is an input and button.

On the search page, we will perform a search request to NASA API and process incoming results.

There are a thumbnail and nasa_id on each object. We will display a thumbnail in the grid when the user clicks on the title, we will redirect to the details page and show the rest of the collection.



### At the end of the recap 
 
 
 - You will grasp remote data fetch & promises and dom manipulation.

- If you wish to continue, explore other endpoints of API and create new pages and add this project to your portfolio.
